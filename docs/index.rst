pynsq
=====

The official Python client library for `NSQ <https://github.com/nsqio/nsq>`_

It provides high-level :class:`nsq.Reader` and :class:`nsq.Writer` classes for building
consumers and producers and two low-level modules for both sync and async communication over the
`NSQ Protocol <http://nsq.io/clients/tcp_protocol_spec.html>`_ (if you wanted
to write your own high-level functionality).

The async module is built on top of the `Tornado IOLoop <http://tornadoweb.org>`_ and as
such requires ``tornado`` to be installed.
